## Outside resources
+ I incorporated some ideas from a [blog post about using CSS to style \<blockquote\> tags](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/simple-and-nice-blockquote-styling/).
+ I also used some ideas from a [StackOverflow post about sizing a \<div\> based on window height](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7527152/div-with-dynamic-min-height-based-on-browser-window-height#25651554).
